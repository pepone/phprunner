JS.Class is a JavaScript library for building object-oriented programs using Ruby
idioms. It implements Ruby's core object/module/class system in JavaScript, as well
as several standard Ruby libraries and various other extensions.


Distribution files
---

The distribution contains the following files:

* `core.js` - contains `Class`, `Module`, `Kernel`, `Singleton` and `Interface`
* `loader.js` - the `Package` system and dependency data for the core object
  system and the standard library.
* `stdlib.js` - the whole standard library in one file

The remaining files should be self-explanatory; each contains a single piece of the
standard library; see [the website](http://jsclass.jcoglan.com) for documentation.
