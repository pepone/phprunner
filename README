This archive contains the source code for PhpRunner.

Description
-----------

  PhpRunner is a C++ service that facilitate the task of run PHP
scripts that run for long period of time.

 Usually is not possible to run long time PHP process inside a web server
because the connection timeouts on the web server will prevent the process
to run successfully, and will end forcefully.

  With PhpRunner you can launch your scripts from any PHP page and then
pool the server to know the status of the scripts, if you want to terminate
and script it is also possible to kill the process remotely.


The Server
----------

  The server is written C++:

  Ice (Internet Communication Engine | http://www.zeroc.com) is used for
the communications between the C++ Server and the PHP web pages.

  Nokia Qt toolkit (http://qt.nokia.com/products/) is used to manage
system processes using QProcess class (http://doc.trolltech.com/qprocess.html)

  Source code for the server is provided in src/server folder subdirectory of this
distribution.

Simple PHP demo
---------------

  There is a simple PHP demo under demo subdirectory, the demo is a simple PHP
Web Application that list the task running in PhpRunner service, allow to add
new taks, and kill the already running tasks.


  To create the PHP demo i have used my own simple PHP framework oz-web, that is
a small set of classes that helps to create PHP Web applications.

The PHP demo source code is under demo subdirectory of this distribution,

  * demo/scripts:

  In this directory we place the PHP scripts that can be run inside PhpRunner,
the demo use a single script "DemoScript.php" demo/oz-web subdirectory contains
the demo application, let see some more details of the demo application.

  * demo/oz-web/Init.php:
  -----------------------
  This file contains the application configuration, see comments
in the file for details, in particular you should update ICE_PATH to set the path to Ice
php include that match your Ice setup.

  * demo/oz-web/src/controller/public/DefaultPageController.php
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  This file define the web pages of our demo application.

  * demo/oz-web/src/controller/public/PhpRunnerPageController.php
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  This file manage communications between PhpRunner service and the web browser, the
communications are done using AJAX and JSON.

Building the Server
-------------------

Extract the PhpRunner archive in any directory you like (for example,
in your home directory):

  $ tar xvfz PhpRunner-1.0.0.tar.gz

Change the working directory to PhpRunner-1.0.0:

  $ cd PhpRunner-1.0.0

Edit config/qmake.rules to establish your C++ build configuration. 
The comments in the file provide more information.

To build the server execute the following commands:

 $ qmake -recursive
 $ make

To install the server execute the following commands:

 $ make install.


Running the Server.
-------------------

Review configuration file "/opt/phprunner/config/config.phprunner".

To run the server first ensure that lib subdirectory is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, that
can be done with the following command:

  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/phprunner/lib

Then you can run the server with the following command:

  $ /opt/bin/oz-phprunner --Ice.Config=/opt/phprunner/config/config.phprunner

Setup PHP demo.
---------------

  The easy way to setup the PHP demo is to create a new apache virtual host

  Here is a sample virtual host configuration file you can use, where to place
the Virtual Host configuration depends of your apache setup so you should consult
your system documentation, in linux distros this is usually under /etc/apache/...

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName  phprunner.loc

    DocumentRoot /var/www/phprunner/demo/oz-web/online/
   <Directory "/var/www/phprunner/demo/oz-web/online/">

        Options +FollowSymLinks -Indexes
        RewriteEngine On


        AllowOverride All
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>


  Add "phprunner.loc" to your "/etc/hosts"

    $ nano /etc/hosts

  and add the following line

    127.0.14.1      phprunner.loc

  Create a symbolic link to the sources under you apache directory
for example in Ubuntu i do.

    $ cd /var/wwww
    $ sudo ln -s /home/pepone/phprunner .

  Restart apache a point your web browser to "http://phprunner.loc" if all goes great you
will see a web page similar to our online demo at "http://phprunner.ydra.org".
